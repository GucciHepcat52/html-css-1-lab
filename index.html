    <p class="introduction">
      Guild Wars 2 is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed
      by ArenaNet and published by NCSoft and ArenaNet. Set in the fantasy world
      of Tyria, the game follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded
      guild dedicated to fighting the Elder Dragons, a Lovecraftian species that
      has seized control of Tyria in the time since the original Guild Wars. To
      take on your many adventures, players have many classes to choose from
      that can be altered in endless ways to fit their desired playstyle.

        />
        Warriors are masters of weaponry who rely on speed, strength, toughness,
        and heavy armor to survive in battle. Adrenaline fuels their offensive
        powerâ€”the longer warriors stay in a fight, the more dangerous they
        become.

          alt="Picture of Guardian Profession"
        />
        Guardians are devoted fighters who protect their allies and smite their
        enemies by drawing from the power of their virtues. True guardians are
        brilliant tacticians and selfless defenders who know how to empower
        their allies to achieve victory.

          alt="Picture of Revenant Profession"
        />
        Heavily armored and equipped with the otherworldly powers of the Mists,
        revenants channel Tyria's legends to slaughter foes, unleash chaos on
        the battlefield, and support their allies.

          alt="Picture of Engineer Profession"
        />
        Masters of mechanical mayhem, engineers love to tinker with explosives,
        elixirs, and all manner of hazardous gadgets. They support their allies
        with alchemic weaponry, deploy ingenious inventions, or lay waste to
        foes with a wide array of mines, bombs, and grenades.

          alt="Picture of Ranger Profession"
        />
        Rangers rely on a keen eye, a steady hand, and the power of nature
        itself. Unparalleled survivalists with traps, nature spirits, and a
        stable of loyal pets at their command, rangers can adapt to any
        situation.

          alt="Picture of Ranger Profession"
        />
        Experts at stealth and surprise, thieves move through the shadows,
        vanish into thin air, or steal items from their opponents and use them
        as weapons. Thieves practice an agile, acrobatic fighting style, which
        makes them very hard to hit.

      <h2 class="profession-name">Elementalist</h2>
      <p class="profession-description">

          alt="Picture of Elementalist Profession"
        />
        Elementalists are multifaceted spellcasters who channel elemental
        forces, making fire, air, earth, and water do their bidding. What they
        lack in physical toughness, they make up for in versatility and the
        ability to inflict massive damage.

      <h2 class="profession-name">Necromancer</h2>
      <p class="profession-description">

          src="https://guildwars2.staticwars.com/wp-content/themes/guildwars2.com-live/img/professions/list-necromancer.1df803ee.jpg"
          alt="Picture of Necromancer Profession"
        />
        Practitioners of the dark arts, necromancers summon minions, wield the
        power of ritual, and heal themselves with blood magic. Necromancers feed
        on life force, which they can leverage offensively or use to delay their
        own demise.

    <div style="clear: both"></div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="profession-name">Mesmer</h2>
      <p class="profession-description">
        <img
          src="https://guildwars2.staticwars.com/wp-content/themes/guildwars2.com-live/img/professions/list-mesmer.cd1df4d2.jpg"
          alt="Picture of Mesmer Profession"
        />
        Mesmers are magical duelists who wield deception as a weapon. Using
        powerful illusions, clones, and phantasmal magic to ensure that their
        enemies can't believe their own eyes, mesmers tip the balance of every
        fight in their favor.
